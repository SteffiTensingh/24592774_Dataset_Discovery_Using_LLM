We are compiling this time series data from state and local governments and health departments in an attempt to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak. Since late January, The Times has tracked cases of coronavirus in real time as they were identified after testing. Because of the widespread shortage of testing, however, the data is necessarily limited in the picture it presents of the outbreak. We have used this data to power our [maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) and [reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/coronavirus) tracking the outbreak, and it is now being made available to the public in response to requests from researchers, scientists and government officials who would like access to the data to better understand the outbreak. The data begins with the first reported coronavirus case in Washington State on Jan. 21, 2020. We will publish regular updates to the data in this repository. # United States Data Data on cumulative coronavirus cases and deaths can be found in two files for states and counties. Each row of data reports cumulative counts based on our best reporting up to the moment we publish an update. We do our best to revise earlier entries in the data when we receive new information. Both files contain [FIPS codes](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/fips), a standard geographic identifier, to make it easier for an analyst to combine this data with other data sets like a map file or population data. ## State-Level Data State-level data can be found in the us-states.csv file. date,state,fips,cases,deaths 2020-01-21,Washington,53,1,0 ... ## County-Level Data County-level data can be found in the us-counties.csv file. date,county,state,fips,cases,deaths 2020-01-21,Snohomish,Washington,53061,1,0 ... In some cases, the geographies where cases are reported do not map to standard county boundaries. See the list of [geographic exceptions](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data#geographic-exceptions) for more detail on these. # Github Repository This dataset contains COVID-19 data for the United States of America made available by The New York Times on github at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data\\n\\nCaveats - If you have questions about the data or licensing conditions, please contact us at:\\r\\n\\r\\ncovid-data@nytimes.com\\n\\nMethodology - Other\\n\\nSource: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/nyt-covid-19-data  \\nLast updated at https://data.humdata.org/organization/hdx : 2020-05-18  \\n\\n\\nLicense - \\nOther  \\n\\n[More information about the license](https://data.humdata.org/about/license)', 'Manually checked only once.

The ratio uses data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. An adequate, nutritious diet is a necessity at all stages of life. Inadequate diets can impair intellectual performance and have been linked to more frequent school absence and poorer educational achievement in children. Nutrition also plays a significant role in causing or preventing a number of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, some cancers, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and anemia. At least two factors influence the affordability of food and the dietary choices of families – the cost of food and family income. The inability to afford food is a major factor in food insecurity, which has a spectrum of effects including anxiety over food sufficiency or food shortages; reduced quality or desirability of diet; and disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.

In this release, counts of deaths are provided by the race and Hispanic origin of the decedent. Topics will be added to the release as they become available. These provisional counts are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. Data shown on this page may be incomplete and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Data on this page are revised weekly and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks. Weighted population distributions more accurately reflect race/ethnic distributions of the geographic locations where COVID outbreaks are occurring (see below for the methods used to calculate weighted percentages). The weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. See Table 2 below for unweighted populations. Estimated distributions of COVID-19 deaths and population size by race and Hispanic origin The percentages of COVID-19 deaths by race and Hispanic origin were calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths for each race and Hispanic origin group by the total number of COVID-19 deaths. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. The distribution of deaths involving COVID-19 by race/ethnicity should not be compared to the race/ethnicity distribution of the U.S. population because COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain geographic locations where the racial and ethnic population distribution differs from that of the United States overall. Additionally, COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain areas within states, and it is therefore not appropriate to compare the percent of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity to the racial/ethnic population distribution of a given state. To make the estimated population distribution more comparable to the geographic areas where COVID-19 deaths are occurring, weighted population distributions are provided in this report. The weighted population distributions were calculated as follows. County-level population counts by race and Hispanic origin were multiplied by the corresponding total count of COVID-19 deaths by county (of residence). These weighted counts were then summed to the state (or national) level. The percentage of the population within each race and Hispanic origin group by state (or for the U.S.) was then estimated using these weighted counts. Counties with no COVID-19 deaths received a weight of zero, and thus do not contribute to the weighted population totals. Population counts for counties with large numbers of COVID-19 deaths are upweighted proportional to their numbers of COVID-19 deaths. These weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. For example, assume that 75% of the total number of COVID deaths occurred in a single county, County X, while the other 25% of COVID deaths occurred in County Y, and all other counties reported zero deaths. The weighted population counts for County X would contribute 75% of the total population counts, while the population counts for Count\\n\\nSource: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-death-counts-for-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-weekly-state-specific-data-updat-9c2c7  \\nLast updated at https://catalog.data.gov/organization/hhs-gov : 2020-06-20  \\n[More about U.S. Government Works](https://www.usa.gov/government-works)\\n\\n', 'This dataset contains the number of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths by country and subnational region due to the Coronavirus pandemic in Europe.
